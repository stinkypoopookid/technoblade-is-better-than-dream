        <h1 id="dream-cheater">LOL DREAM IS THE BIGGEST CHEATER IN MINECRAFT IT'S SO OBVIOUS AND HE IS SO BLATANT!!!</h1>

        <p id="why-dream-cheats> dream is the biggest hacker because he is a <em>green bitch</em> and he smells bad. 
        Also his dumpy is really <em>big</em> and it makes me uncomfortable. 
        <strong>TECHNOBLADE IS BETTER THAN DREAM!!!!! FUCK DREAM</strong>. </p>

        <h2 id="technoblade-better">WHY TECHNOBLADE IS BETTER THAN DREAM</h2>

        <p id=technoblade-better-paragraph> technoblade is so much better than dream because he doesn't have a big dumpy. <br>
            Technoblade is so much better at pvp and he beat dream in mr breast 100k duel. <br> 
            Technoblade is better because dream has more fan fics. <br> </p>
